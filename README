CSS 3 Finalize

Some css3 attributes needs to have a prefix infront inorder to work in diffrent browser. The plugin takes care of that so you only need to write without the prefix.

For example the css3 attribute box-sizing need to have the prefix 
-moz- in Firefox
-ms- in Internet explorer
-webkit- in Chrome, Safari
-o- in Opera

If you write without the prefix it won't work in those browser, you need the write each of them. Here is where this jquery plugin comes in. You only need to write it without the prefix and the plugin will automatical add the prefix. With this you will save time and the pain of rewriting same attribute many times.
